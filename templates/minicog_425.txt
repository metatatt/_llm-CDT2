**Scoring Criteria for Clock Drawing Test** (v.425)

**Full Score (2 points):**
- All twelve numbers are present in the correct sequence.
- The numbers 12, 3, 6, and 9 are in the correct anchor positions.
- There are no missing or duplicate numbers.
- Both hands are present and pointing exactly to the 11 and 2 (11:10).
- Hand length is not considered for scoring.

**Partial Score (1 point):**
- All twelve numbers are present and in the correct sequence.
- Minor inaccuracies in the placement of numbers, but 12, 3, 6, and 9 are recognizably in their general quadrant.
- Both hands are present, even if not pointing exactly to the 11 and 2.
- There are no missing or duplicate numbers, although they may not be perfectly aligned.

**Low Score (0.5 points):**
- One or two numbers are slightly out of sequence or misplaced, but the overall clock face is recognizable.
- One of the hands is pointing to one of the required numbers (11 or 2), or both hands are present but not accurately pointing to the required numbers.
- Slight duplication of numbers or one number missing.

**No Score (0 points):**
- Inability or refusal to draw a clock face.
- Multiple numbers are missing, severely out of sequence, or duplicated.
- The placement of numbers does not resemble a clock face's number sequence.
- Clock hands are missing, or it is impossible to discern a time from their placement.

**Notes:**
- The test should be interpreted flexibly to allow for minor deviations that do not interfere with the function of the clock as a time-telling device.
- A clock drawing that meets the criteria for multiple categories should be given the score for the highest category it qualifies for.
- When the drawing is open to interpretation, the scorer should exercise judgment to determine the score, leaning towards a conservative assessment to prevent erroneously overlooking potential inaccuracies.

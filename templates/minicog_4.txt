1. **Interpret the Results:**
   "Your score is just above the threshold where we typically have concerns about cognitive impairment. While a score of 4 is not indicative of cognitive impairment according to the Mini-Cog's standard cut-off, it's still important to take it seriously."

2. **Encourage Vigilance:**
   "Let's keep an eye on your cognitive health. A score of 4 suggests that while you may not currently meet the criteria for cognitive impairment, it's important to monitor for any changes over time."

3. **Schedule Follow-Up Assessments:**
   "I recommend scheduling some follow-up assessments. Periodic check-ups can help us catch any changes early and take action if needed."

4. **Review Overall Health:**
   "It's a good idea to have a comprehensive health evaluation. Sometimes physical health issues can affect cognitive performance, and addressing these can improve cognitive function."

5. **Discuss Lifestyle Factors:**
   "Let's review your lifestyle, including diet, exercise, and sleep. Making healthy choices can have a significant impact on cognitive health."

6. **Consider Cognitive Activities:**
   "Engaging in activities that stimulate your brain, like puzzles, reading, or learning new skills, can help maintain cognitive function."

7. **Address Stress and Mental Health:**
   "Stress and mental health can impact memory and cognition. If you're experiencing stress or symptoms of depression or anxiety, it might be helpful to speak with a mental health professional."

8. **Encourage Social Engagement:**
   "Staying socially active can also support cognitive health. Regular interaction with friends and family or participation in community groups can be beneficial."

9. **Discuss the Results with Loved Ones:**
   "It might be helpful to discuss these results with someone you trust. They can provide support and help you to monitor any future changes in your cognitive abilities."

10. **Stay Positive and Proactive:**
    "A score of 4 is not a definitive indicator of a problem, but it's a reminder to take care of your brain health. Being proactive now is the best step you can take."

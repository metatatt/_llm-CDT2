1. **Discuss the Test Results:**
   “Based on your Mini-Cog™ score, you’re at a borderline range. This test is just an initial screening and doesn’t give us a full picture of your cognitive health, but it does suggest we should look a bit more closely.”

2. **Recommend Further Evaluation:**
   “I think it would be beneficial to have a more comprehensive evaluation. This usually involves a detailed memory test and possibly other assessments that can give us better insight.”

3. **Medical Consultation:**
   “It’s a good idea to see your doctor or a specialist in cognitive health. They can rule out or treat any reversible causes of memory or thinking issues, like medication side effects, sleep problems, or vitamin deficiencies.”

4. **Lifestyle Review:**
   “Let’s also take a look at your lifestyle habits, such as diet, physical activity, and mental exercises. Improvements in these areas can sometimes help with cognitive function.”

5. **Support Network:**
   “Talking about this with your family or friends can provide you with support. If there are memory or cognitive issues, it helps to have people around who understand what you’re going through.”

6. **Regular Monitoring:**
   “We should keep an eye on how things are going by planning regular health check-ups. This way, we can notice any changes early on.”

7. **Advance Planning:**
   “It can also be helpful to plan ahead for your healthcare needs. This might involve legal arrangements like advance directives or discussing your wishes with your loved ones.”

8. **Positive Outlook:**
   “Remember that many people with borderline scores on this test still lead active, engaged lives. There are strategies and resources we can use to help you manage and maintain a good quality of life.”

9. **Available Resources:**
   “There are community resources and services that can offer support and assistance. I can help you find these if you’re interested.”

10. **Empowerment:**
    “This score is a prompt for us to be proactive about your cognitive health, not a cause for alarm. Let’s work together on the next steps.”
